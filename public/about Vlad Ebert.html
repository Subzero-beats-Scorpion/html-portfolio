<h1>About Vlad Ebert</h1>

<p>I am a beginner Web Developer. It is an activity that I enjoy. My background is actually in music; I am a violinist at heart. However, I started coding because I felt the need for some changes in my life.</p>
<p>I hope this change, or perhaps I should say this addition to my life, will bring me satisfaction along the way. I pray to God that I find a job with a nice atmosphere and friendly coworkers.</p>
<p>I have struggled all my life to find motivation in doing something, but finally, at the age of 36, it seems that with coding, I can wake up very early, learn, and work on coding exercises and projects. I guess that's a good sign. Going to bed early is working well, too. I have to say, I am proud of myself for doing this. I am happy—because of the journey and because of the goals.</p>
<p>In this project, I applied what I’ve learned about HTML, including key concepts like heading and paragraph elements, void elements, nesting, indentation, and anchor and image tags. I also explored file paths and webpage structures. Angela Yu’s teaching style, with her humor and clear explanations, made the learning process engaging and enjoyable.</p>
